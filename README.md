# Patient Research Management Application 

This project is an object-oriented design for managing and using diagnostic data. The project uses data shared by researchers at the University of Arkansas for Medical Research. For 21 patients, the normalized protein expression level is provided for 4776 proteins. The protein data was collected from the patients before treatment. Following treatment, the patient was identified as either CR - complete response - or DP - disease progression. Using the Weka J48 Decision Tree algorithm, machine learning was applied to the provided data set, and an algorithm was developed to predict a patient's response to treatment.

Project Requirements:
- maintain a database of patients
- ability to add and remove patients
- update patient data
- predict treatment response
- stores patient data in csv file
- ability to query the system
